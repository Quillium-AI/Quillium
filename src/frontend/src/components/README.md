# Components

This directory contains reusable React components for the Quillium UI.

## Component Structure

Components should follow these guidelines:

- Each component should be in its own directory
- Include a test file for each component
- Export the component as the default export
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Example Component Structure

```
Button/
├── Button.jsx
├── Button.css
├── Button.test.jsx
└── index.js
```
